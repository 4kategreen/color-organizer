Color Organizer
===

This application will take your site's LESS or Sass variable set and create a page of colors to view and work with.

In the future, I'd like to:
- create ways to parse LESS and Sass color math.
- parse and display ems and other font sizes.
- show types of variables in combination with each other (say, link colors on top of background)
